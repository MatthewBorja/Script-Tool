# Introduction
Steam Console Client or SteamCMD is the command-line version of Steam. SteamCMD is the popular solution for hosting dedicated servers.
SteamCMD enables the user to install and update server files fetched from Steam servers for various games. This is all accomplished
without needing an account, as would be the case if you did this through the client which would create problems when trying to play
as well as host a server.

# Script Tool
Automating the process is the objective of the script tool.

`ScriptTool.exe` will guide the user through the creation of a script. A script provides SteamCMD with a list of commands to execute.
Scripts can be manually entered or read from a `database.dat` file. For demonstration purposes, a finite list of options exist in
the database. Additional entries will be added in a future update.
